## Governance

This GitHub public repository ( **[https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-documentation](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-documentation)** ) was [proposed](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti/201609/msg00001.html) and [approved](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ballot.php?id=2971) [[bis](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/TCADMIN-2435)] by the [OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti/) as an [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.
