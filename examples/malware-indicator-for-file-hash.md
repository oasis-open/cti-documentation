title: Malware Indicator for File Hash
categories: examples
---

A commonly-shared form of threat intelligence as practiced today is the sharing of host-based indicators for malicious code, which are most often file names and hashes. This example describes a file hash indicator and the name and type of the piece of malware that it indicates.

**Scenario**
----------

This scenario consists of the description of a simple indicator that represents a pattern for a file with a given hash and the context that if a file with that hash is seen it might indicate a sample of Poison Ivy is present.

**Data model**
----------

An [Indicator](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IvkLxg_tCnICsatu2lyxKmWmh1gY2h8HUNssKIE-UIA/pub#h.muftrcpnf89v) STIX Domain Object (SDO) is used to model patterns of expression such as the Poison Ivy file hash in this example. This hash is represented using the <span class="sdo">**pattern**</span> property of the Indicator object which is based on the [STIX patterning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nK1RXcE2aMvQoG1Kgr3aTBtHZ1IyehzOk7vU0n5FUGY/pub) language. With this language, a comparison expression of the SHA-256 hash looks like: <span class="values">\[file:hashes.'SHA-256'= 'ef537f25c895bfa782526529a9b63d97aa631564d5d789c2b765448c8635fb6c'\]</span>. If known, other file attributes such as names or paths can be represented. Also, while this example covers just a file hash, many other [Cyber Observable Objects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/167aIyr5BIAJJORzjT11U25cGSBJ0cBNSdkheNJFz6l8/pub) and their properties can be modeled using Indicator patterns. For instance, email messages, domains, IP addresses, and processes are just a few examples.

Indicator objects also require a <span class="sdo">**labels**</span> property which helps to define what type of indicator is being represented. In this scenario, the hash value is associated with Poison Ivy, a known nefarious type of malware, so this indicator is labeled as <span class="values">malicious-activity</span>. This value is taken from the [Indicator Label](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dIrh1Lp3KAjEMm8o2VzAmuV0Peu-jt9aAh1IHrjAroM/pub#h.cvhfwe3t9vuo) open vocabulary which provides other useful labels for classifying indicators.

Next, the details of the Poison Ivy malware are captured using a STIX [Malware](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IvkLxg_tCnICsatu2lyxKmWmh1gY2h8HUNssKIE-UIA/pub#h.s5l7katgbp09) object. Malware objects in STIX also contain a required <span class="sdo">**labels**</span> property that is needed to specify the type of malware. In this case, Poison Ivy is a <span class="values">remote-access-trojan</span>. This value comes from the [Malware Label](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dIrh1Lp3KAjEMm8o2VzAmuV0Peu-jt9aAh1IHrjAroM/pub#h.8cyb6e9yqzwr) open vocabulary, which contains several common types of malware categories such as virus, backdoor, spyware, etc.

These SDO’s are then coupled together via a [Relationship](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IvkLxg_tCnICsatu2lyxKmWmh1gY2h8HUNssKIE-UIA/pub#h.e2e1szrqfoan) STIX Relationship Object (SRO). This Relationship connects the <span class="sdo">**source\_ref**</span>, Indicator, with the <span class="sdo">**target\_ref**</span>, Malware, via an <span class="values">indicates</span> <span class="sdo">**relationship\_type**</span>.

A diagram of this relationship below shows the Indicator and Malware SDO’s and the Relationship SRO between them:
